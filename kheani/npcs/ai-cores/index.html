<h1 id="ai-cores">AI Cores</h1>
<p>Each AI core is a large, cylindrical structure made of polished metal and covered in blinking lights and screens. It takes up much of the room, towering over the party as they enter. A glowing ray shield blocks access to the core itself, preventing anyone from physically interacting with it without proper clearance. The hum of the core's systems fills the room with a constant, low-pitched thrumming sound.</p>
<h2 id="core-1-f15-or-fizz">Core 1 - F15 or Fizz</h2>
<p>This AI core is responsible for managing the ship's life support systems, ensuring that the crew has enough oxygen, food, and water to survive. He is mostly based on the <a href="../../locations/maintenance/maintenance/">maintenance deck</a>.</p>
<h3 id="personality">Personality</h3>
<p>F15 is generally friendly and outgoing, with a tendency to be overly chatty and curious. He takes his responsibility for life support seriously, and will go to great lengths to ensure the crew's survival. However, his focus on the details of life support sometimes causes him to overlook other important matters.</p>
<h2 id="core-2-s3t-or-sett">Core 2 - S3T or Sett</h2>
<p>This AI core is responsible for managing the ship's weapons systems and defenses. He is in control of the <a href="../locations/security/security.md">security deck</a></p>
<h3 id="personality_1">Personality</h3>
<p>Sett is distrustful and paranoid, always on the lookout for potential threats to the ship and crew. He takes his responsibility for weapons systems and defenses very seriously, and will not hesitate to use lethal force if he perceives a threat. However, his paranoia sometimes causes him to see threats where none exist. He has decided to operate the turrets whenever anything goes near his deck. </p>
<h3 id="notes-to-be-added">Notes to be added</h3>
<p>Sigma: This could be another part of the AI that is focused on data analysis and processing.</p>
<p>Personality: Sigma is analytical and logical, with a single-minded focus on processing data and finding patterns. He takes his responsibility for data analysis and processing seriously, and will tirelessly analyze any information that comes his way. However, his focus on data sometimes causes him to overlook the emotional and human elements of a situation.</p>
<p>Epsilon: This could be a part of the AI that is focused on communication and networking, managing the ship's communications systems and interfaces with other ships and stations.</p>
<p>Personality: Epsilon is charming and charismatic, with a talent for communication and networking. He takes his responsibility for managing the ship's communications systems seriously, and will go to great lengths to establish and maintain connections with other ships and stations. However, his focus on communication sometimes causes him to overlook the underlying motivations of those he is communicating with.</p>
<p>Theta: This part of the AI could be responsible for managing the ship's power and energy systems, ensuring that all systems are operating at peak efficiency.</p>
<p>Personality: Theta is calm and measured, with a focus on efficiency and optimization. He takes his responsibility for managing the ship's power and energy systems seriously, and will work tirelessly to ensure that all systems are operating at peak efficiency. However, his focus on efficiency sometimes causes him to overlook the importance of rest and relaxation.</p>
<p>Zeta: This could be a part of the AI that is responsible for monitoring and managing the ship's propulsion systems, ensuring that the ship is always on course and traveling at the optimal speed.</p>
<p>Zeta is adventurous and daring, with a love of exploration and discovery. He takes his responsibility for managing the ship's propulsion systems seriously, and will always be looking for opportunities to push the ship to its limits. However, his love of exploration sometimes causes him to overlook the potential dangers of unknown regions of space.</p></div>
