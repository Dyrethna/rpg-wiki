Despite its idyllic setting, there is an air of tension in the town. The townsfolk are on edge, speaking in hushed tones and casting nervous glances over their shoulders. Rumors of strange happenings in the woods and mysterious disappearances have been circulating for weeks, and the local authorities seem unable or unwilling to do anything about it. The townsfolk themselves are a mix of hardworking farmers, skilled craftsmen, and adventurous merchants. Most are friendly and hospitable, eager to welcome outsiders into their community. However, there are also those who are more suspicious and closed off, wary of outsiders and unwilling to share their secrets. The town's leader is a gruff and no-nonsense figure, known simply as the Mayor. He is a tall, broad-shouldered man with a thick beard and piercing blue eyes. Despite his intimidating appearance, he has a soft spot for the town's children and is known to be fiercely protective of his people. Other notable figures in the town include a kindly old blacksmith who is always willing to lend a hand, a sharp-tongued tavern owner with a heart of gold, and a mysterious ranger who is rumored to know the secrets of the surrounding forests. Overall, Stonewood is a welcoming and charming town, but one that is also on the brink of danger.

to the great sea is a huge system of caverns. If you didn't know the right one to enter it would be impossible to find. Nestled in what looked like a normal crevasse is a dark hole, that quickly opens to a narrow passage. These holes and paths look entirely natural, carved by water and time. The Caves The caves on Kheani VI are dark, damp, and treacherous, and are streaked with white, pink and red (from the iron and magnesium content). Stalactites hang from the ceiling, and the floors are slick with moss and algae. The air is thick with the smell of damp earth and the distant sound of running water. The party will need to navigate through a series of narrow passageways and low tunnels, some of which are barely big enough for a person to fit through. The cave system is home to a variety of creatures, including Mynocks, which can be found clinging to the ceilings and walls. As the party delves deeper into the caves, the temperature will begin to rise, making it increasingly difficult to navigate. The walls will become hot to the touch, and the air will be thick with steam. The party will need to be careful not to get lost in the maze-like caves, as some passages lead to dead ends, while others lead to dangerous chasms and underground rivers. The party will eventually come across a large chamber that is oddly shaped. The chamber is filled with a thick mist that makes it difficult to see, but the party will be able to make out the silhouette of an tube partially buried in the cave wall. The ship is made of a refined and unusual metal that is unlike anything the party has ever seen before. Cavern 1 Cavern one is quite a way into the rock, it is still possible to see without lights if barely. The commlink however does start to give out, and the ship cannot be heard clearly. \"That is odd, these are designed to be used in caves. Must be the same thing that is confusing our scans\" says Mirri . On the opposite wall there are two cracks, the right one leads quickly to Cavern 2. The left one bends right and then left and meets another tunnel. Right leads to Cavern 4, and left will threaten death with a swarm of Mynocks, you can just hear chittering if you linger too long at this junction. Cavern 2 Cavern 2 is downhill from cavern 1 and 3, and has an opening above it. With the faint sunlight, you can just about see the floor and the hole in the middle of the floor. If the players look closely they will start to see strange metallics in the ceiling and wall. Also if anyone looks really closely they will notice this room will flood quickly and prevent passage through in a harsh rainstorm. Cavern 2 has one exit to the right that leads to Cavern 3. Cavern 3 A larger cavern, and the kinked passageway from Cavern 2 makes this pitch black. You can hear things moving on the walls, but every time you sweep a torch over them they fall silent and still. There are a few streams of water cascading down the walls and heading towards Cavern 2 (downhill). To the right is a dead end with a corpse at the end. Fairly recently dead, anyone with medical knowledge can see they were eaten by the teeth marks on the bones. Straight ahead is a narrow passage that quickly becomes too narrow to pass, you can faintly here running water. To the left is the first reasonable sized passage to cavern 5. Cavern 4 A small cavern with some fungi growing in it. A proficient biologist could recognise guano on the floor and the size would indicate bat type creatures that would pose a threat to the party. Most of the mushrooms are edible, some are hallucinogenic and some are emetic. The moss growing up the walls moves as you get closer to it. Opposite the way in is a path to another junction. The left path abruptly ends in a dead end , The right path leads to Cavern 5. Cavern 5 The largest cavern of them all, entirely dominated on one side by a shiny flat surface. Even an idiot can see this is not natural. There are markings on the surface which will need to be deciphered. As time wears on, you get an idea that this is common but old, and not with standard Aurabesh. It says 'Anthala' and under that 'Main' and then maybe an 'l'. You can't make out the rest. On a Hard Perception check on the letters, the party can realise the fifth letter is a t, making it likely maintenance. On a Normal Percpetion check on the wall, there is a panel that is partly covered by the rocks. A Hard Althetics check will allow the party to open it, showing a control panel. Once open, Mirri will remark it doesn't look like a familiar make. Hot wiring the door with a Hard Skullduggery check will pop open a hatch allowing the party to enter the first area, Anthala - engine maintenance . Dead end If looked at with more than a passing glance this will show the refined metal of something old and sophisticated. Further investigation on a Normal Perception check will show a panel on the wall. This can be opened with a Hard Mechanics check or a Normal Slicing (codebreaking) check.

Door Left Opens onto the lower deck onto the maintenance hub , this is the intended path and the safest place to go. Door Right Opens onto the upper deck, Door Above This door is the way into the droid maintenance section. It contains many old parts stacked on shelves.

If you are interested in joining this exciting adventure, please contact me at mar_rendas:gentleman_explorer:ord_cestus by Taungsday next week. Don't miss this opportunity to make history with me!\" Act 1 The party are recruited to help retrieve some treasure from the planet Kheani VI . The rich gentleman explorer, Mar Rendas has put out an advert for recruits. He is looking for a group of archaeologists, scientists and combat specialists to support his excavation of a possible treasure. Mar Rendas has a map to the hidden entrance to Anthala . He has been in the cave briefly, but needed more supplies and help. Invited to Mar's base of operation on Ord Cestus , the party find a well organised set of offices and equipment storage. They will be greeted by Mirri who will grab their clothing measurements and escort them up into the offices to be briefed. The briefing will be in a glass walled office on the top floor, overlooking the complex. Infomation is limited, Mar had to leave quite quickly last time as there was a significant presence of Mynocks that they were not expecting. Their sensors had detected something made out of refined and unusual metal, but the entire planet has a layer of high density metals, so it is hard to pin down anything specific. After the briefing the players will each get a environment suit which includes 12 hours of oxygen. They will also be given some rope and other climbing gear. Finally the party will embark on a ship to go to Kheani . Act 2 After arriving, the party, Mar Rendas and his assistant investigate the caves . There are multiple paths to the bottom, with creatures infesting the ceilings. As they dive deeper the metal of the ship becomes more obvious. Once deep in the caves, the temperature will start to increase until it is unbearable. This will force the party to take the maintenance shaft at the bottom of the cave and retreat to the Anthala properly. If they are reluctant, 70 degree rain can be introduced to prevent them from leaving and start to flood the caves. Act 3 Opening the door to the maintenance deck starts the timer. The party will need to prevent the leaks to give themselves more time. There are a few puzzles to solve to unlock the first few rooms and secure them. As they finally rest, safe for the moment, the monster grabs Mirri with tentacles and drags her away screaming. Silence.
