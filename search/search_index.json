The town is built around a central square, with quaint stone buildings lining the narrow streets. The sound of a nearby waterfall provides a constant backdrop to daily life in Stonewood. Despite its idyllic setting, there is an air of tension in the town. The townsfolk are on edge, speaking in hushed tones and casting nervous glances over their shoulders. Rumors of strange happenings in the woods and mysterious disappearances have been circulating for weeks, and the local authorities seem unable or unwilling to do anything about it. The townsfolk themselves are a mix of hardworking farmers, skilled craftsmen, and adventurous merchants. Most are friendly and hospitable, eager to welcome outsiders into their community. However, there are also those who are more suspicious and closed off, wary of outsiders and unwilling to share their secrets. The town's leader is a gruff and no-nonsense figure, known simply as the Mayor. He is a tall, broad-shouldered man with a thick beard and piercing blue eyes. Despite his intimidating appearance, he has a soft spot for the town's children and is known to be fiercely protective of his people. Other notable figures in the town include a kindly old blacksmith who is always willing to lend a hand, a sharp-tongued tavern owner with a heart of gold, and a mysterious ranger who is rumored to know the secrets of the surrounding forests. Overall, Stonewood is a welcoming and charming town, but one that is also on the brink of danger.

Don't miss this opportunity to make history with me!\" Act 1 The party are recruited to help retrieve some treasure from the planet Kheani VI . The rich gentleman explorer, Mar Rendas has put out an advert for recruits. He is looking for a group of archaeologists, scientists and combat specialists to support his excavation of a possible treasure. Mar Rendas has a map to the hidden entrance to Anthala . He has been in the cave briefly, but needed more supplies and help. Invited to Mar's base of operation on Ord Cestus , the party find a well organised set of offices and equipment storage. They will be greeted by Mirri who will grab their clothing measurements and escort them up into the offices to be briefed. The briefing will be in a glass walled office on the top floor, overlooking the complex. Infomation is limited, Mar had to leave quite quickly last time as there was a significant presence of Mynocks that they were not expecting. Their sensors had detected something made out of refined and unusual metal, but the entire planet has a layer of high density metals, so it is hard to pin down anything specific. After the briefing the players will each get a environment suit which includes 12 hours of oxygen. They will also be given some rope and other climbing gear. Finally the party will embark on a ship to go to Kheani . Act 2 After arriving, the party, Mar Rendas and his assistant investigate the caves . There are multiple paths to the bottom, with creatures infesting the ceilings. As they dive deeper the metal of the ship becomes more obvious. Once deep in the caves, the temperature will start to increase until it is unbearable. This will force the party to take the maintenance shaft at the bottom of the cave and retreat to the Anthala properly. If they are reluctant, 70 degree rain can be introduced to prevent them from leaving and start to flood the caves. Act 3 Opening the door to the maintenance deck starts the timer. The party will need to prevent the leaks to give themselves more time. There are a few puzzles to solve to unlock the first few rooms and secure them. As they finally rest, safe for the moment, the monster grabs Mirri with tentacles and drags her away screaming. Silence.
