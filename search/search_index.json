Despite this, he is also a shrewd negotiator and is able to charm his way out of most situations. Background: Vexx grew up on the streets of Nar Shaddaa and quickly learned the ins and outs of the criminal underworld. He started off as a small-time thief but quickly moved up the ranks, eventually becoming one of the most successful weapons dealers on the moon. He specializes in explosives, and has a reputation for providing his clients with the most powerful and destructive weapons on the market. Vexx operates out of a large warehouse in the lower levels of Nar Shaddaa, where he stores his inventory of weapons and explosives. He has a team of hired thugs that he uses to protect his business and intimidate his rivals. He is always looking for new and powerful weapons to add to his inventory, and is willing to pay a high price for them. Vexx is not particularly loyal to anyone and is willing to sell to anyone as long as they can pay his prices. He has a network of contacts on Nar Shaddaa and across the galaxy, and is able to acquire weapons from a variety of sources. He is also known to have a few illegal weapons which he keeps hidden for the right price.
